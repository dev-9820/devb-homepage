        The Rise of AI in Cinema: How Algorithms Are Changing Storytelling
      </Heading>

      <Text mb={4}>
        Every few decades, cinema gets a new revolution — sound, color, CGI… and now, Artificial Intelligence.
        It’s fascinating to watch how something that once felt so technical is quietly sneaking its way
        into one of the most emotional art forms on earth: storytelling.

        In today’s film studios, AI tools are being used to do more than automate — they inspire. Writers use
        AI to test out dialogues or explore alternate endings; editors experiment with scene pacing through
        predictive algorithms that “sense” audience attention; and visual artists rely on AI to pre-visualize
        complex scenes before cameras even roll.

        Of course, not everyone loves it. Some fear it makes stories mechanical. But I think it does the
        opposite — it helps creators take risks. Imagine a director brainstorming with an AI assistant that
        instantly generates ten visual interpretations of a single scene. The real magic isn’t the output,
        it’s how it pushes human imagination forward.

        Maybe AI won’t replace storytellers — it’ll just become another collaborator in the creative process.
        A digital co-writer who never sleeps, never judges, and keeps reminding us that even in a world full
        of data, emotion still drives the story.
